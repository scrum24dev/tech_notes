To pull a Docker image and then create a container from that image, you can follow these steps. Assuming you have Docker installed and running, here are the commands:

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image

First, you need to pull the Docker image from a repository (like Docker Hub).

```sh
docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
```

For example, to pull the latest Ubuntu image, you would use:

```sh
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

### Step 2: Run a Container from the Pulled Image

After pulling the image, you can create and start a container from it. 

```sh
docker run -it <image_name>:<tag> /bin/bash
```

For example, to run a container from the Ubuntu image, you would use:

```sh
docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

This command will start a new container and open a bash shell inside it. The `-it` flags ensure that the container is interactive and you can use the terminal.

### Step 3: Install Software Inside the Container

Once inside the container, you can install any software you need just like you would on any other Linux system. For example, to install `curl`, you would run:

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Commit the Container to a New Image

If you want to save the changes you've made to the container (e.g., installed software), you can commit the container to a new image.

1. Exit the container (type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`).
2. Find the container ID using `docker ps -a`.
3. Commit the container to a new image:

```sh
docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name>:<tag>
```

For example:

```sh
docker commit 123456789abc my_custom_ubuntu:latest
```

Now you have a new Docker image (`my_custom_ubuntu:latest`) with the installed software.

### Summary of Commands

```sh
# Pull the image
docker pull ubuntu:latest

# Run the container
docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

# Inside the container, install the software
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl

# Exit the container
exit

# Commit the container to a new image
docker commit <container_id> my_custom_ubuntu:latest
```

Replace `<image_name>`, `<tag>`, and `<container_id>` with the appropriate values for your use case.
